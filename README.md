**README for Pydantic Model Validation Project**

**Overview**

This repository contains a Python module that utilizes Pydantic for data validation within a survey data context. The primary focus is on validating survey record entries, ensuring data integrity through various validations such as checking for required fields, validating specific field formats, and enforcing data type constraints.

**Requirements**

Python 3.6+, 
Pydantic

**Features**

SurveyRecord Model: A Pydantic model representing a survey record, including user identifiers, survey metadata, and responses.
Field Validations: Custom validators for specific fields to enforce business logic, such as:
Validating the presence and format of specific fields (q888811_2, missing_column, present_empty).
Enforcing rules on custom logic, like prohibiting certain values or checking for required conditions.
